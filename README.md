# DriverPass
 The DriverPass project is an online app that simplifies driver’s ed by letting students schedule lessons, track progress, and connect with instructors.


-The DriverPass project involved creating an online driver’s education platform for a client who wanted a streamlined way for students to schedule lessons, track progress, and connect with instructors.

-I did well in defining clear requirements and translating them into a user-friendly design, ensuring the system met all specified needs.

-If I could revise one area, I’d improve the requirements gathering by adding more detailed scenarios to make it even clearer how the system would fulfill the client’s needs.

-I focused on the user’s needs by designing features that aligned with their goals, ensuring a positive experience and practical functionality.

-My design approach involves structured analysis using tools like data flow diagrams and use case modeling. In future projects, I’d like to include more user feedback early on to refine the system based on actual user needs.
