# DriverPass
 The DriverPass project is an online app that simplifies driver’s ed by letting students schedule lessons, track progress, and connect with instructors.



-The DriverPass project was focused on creating an online driver’s education platform for a client who wanted to simplify the process for students to schedule lessons, track progress, and connect with instructors. The system was designed to help both students and instructors manage the learning journey smoothly.

-I believe I did well in defining clear, structured requirements and translating them into actionable design components. Developing accurate use cases and data flow diagrams helped ensure that user needs were fully addressed and that the system would be intuitive to navigate.

-If I could revise one part of my work, it would be the requirements gathering section of the business requirements document. I would add more detailed scenarios and examples to make it easier for the client to understand how the system would meet their needs.

-To capture the user’s needs, I translated their goals into detailed system requirements and designed features around user-friendly workflows. Focusing on the user is essential to ensure the system effectively addresses real problems and provides a positive experience.

-In software design, I start with a structured analysis of the requirements, using data flow diagrams and use case modeling to visualize and organize system functions. In the future, I’d like to incorporate more user feedback in the early design stages to refine the system based on real user insights.
